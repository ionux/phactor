## Description

**Phactor** is a high-performance PHP implementation of the elliptic curve math functions required to generate private/public EC keypairs and ECDSA signatures based on secp256k1 curve parameters. This library also includes a class to generate Service Identification Numbers (SINs) based on the published [Identity Protocol v1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Identity_protocol_v1) spec.

These PHP classes are designed to be used in conjunction with software used for Bitcoin-related cryptographic operations right now but the ultimate, long-range goal is to become a more general-purpose mathematics library that can also be used for scientific computing and other non-ecc cryptography projects - basically anywhere you need a convenient interface to arbitrary precision math functions implemented in PHP.

> **Note:** These classes require either the BC or GMP math PHP extension (GMP is preferred but will use BC as the fallback).  You can read more about the GMP extention here: http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.gmp.php

## Installation

Installation of this project is very easy using composer:

```php
php composer.phar require ionux/phactor:1.0.8
```

If you have git installed, you can clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ionux/phactor.git
```

Or you can install manually by downloading a zip file from the [Releases](https://github.com/ionux/phactor/releases) page and extracting the contents into your project's source directory.

> **Note:** Phactor is under active development so you should always download the project from the [Releases](https://github.com/ionux/phactor/releases) page.  Those packages are the only packages you should rely upon in a production environment since the bleeding edge source changes could contain regressions.


## Usage

Integrating these classes with your project is very simple.  For example, after including the necessary **Phactor** class files (or using an autoloader), to generate keypairs:

```php
$key = new \Phactor\Key;

$info = $key->GenerateKeypair();
```

An associative array will be returned upon success:

```sh
Array
(
  [private_key_hex] => 7a4fbece43963538cb8f9149b094906168d71be36cfb405e6930fddb42da2c7d
  [private_key_dec] => 55323065337948610870652254548527896513063178460294714145329611159...
  [public_key] => 043fbbf44c3da3fec12bf7bac254fd176adc3eaed79470932b574d8d60728eb206fb7a...
  [public_key_compressed] => 033fbbf44c3da3fec12bf7bac254fd176adc3eaed79470932b574d8d607...
  [public_key_x] => 3fbbf44c3da3fec12bf7bac254fd176adc3eaed79470932b574d8d60728eb206
  [public_key_y] => fb7ac7ac6959f75a6859a1a8d745db7e825a3c5c826e5b2e4950892b35772313
)
```

Depending on the speed of your hardware, keys can be generated in approximately 10ms or less using GMP.

To generate ECDSA signatures:

```php
$sig = new \Phactor\Signature;

$signature = $sig->generate('my message to sign...', $info['private_key_hex']);
```

Which will return the signature encoded in the ASN.1 DER format:

```sh
30440220421cfa96cb4f735cc768e8e2acd6bdf87c9b731ded3184f05a146ba0709cf24802204a21831926b14...
```

To verify an existing signature, call the Verify() function which returns a boolean true/false:

```php
$sig = new \Phactor\Signature;

if ($sig->Verify($signature, $message, $publickey) == false) {
  // The signature is invalid - reject!
} else {
  // The signature is valid.
}
```

Signatures and keys have been tested against OpenSSL and are interoperable.  In fact, any other project that can import/export correct EC keypairs and ECDSA signatures will be compatible with this library.

> **Note:** All points and signatures are verified to be mathematically correct before they're returned to the caller.  An \Exception is thrown if a point or signature does not pass the verification methods.

The class to generate Service Identification Numbers (SINs) works in a similar fashion. Pass the compressed public key in hex form, for example:

```php
$sin = new \Phactor\Sin;

print_r($sin->Generate($info['public_key_compressed']));
```

Which will return a single, BASE-58 encoded value beginning with the letter 'T' (specific value to SINs).  For example:

```sh
Tf61EPoJDSjbp6tGoyjbTKq7XLABPVcyUwY
```

> **Note:** When using this class to generate SINs for use in a Bitcoin-related project, the usage of *uncompressed* public keys is deprecated.  Use only the compressed public key when generating a SIN for this purpose to remain compatible with the Bitcoin network.
